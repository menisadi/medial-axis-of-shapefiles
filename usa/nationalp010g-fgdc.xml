    <descript>
      <abstract>This polygon shapefile contains the boundaries of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The map layer was created by extracting county polygon features from the 2006 Census TIGER/Line files produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. These files were then merged into a single file and the county and State boundaries were dissolved, leaving the national boundary. This is a revised version of the July 2012 map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.</purpose>

Population values were added from the 2010 Census information. The data were projected by region to the National Atlas Albers Equal Area Conic projection, fields were added for the perimeter measurement and square miles, the values were calculated using ArcMap, and the data were converted back to geographic coordinates.

        <procdesc>Data along the Canadian border were adjusted so that the Canadian and U.S. 1:1,000,000-scale data sets can be used together as seamlessly as possible. Problem areas were identified by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and edits to the U.S. data were performed by the USGS. To identify problems, the National Atlas 1M national boundaries 2012 data set was projected to the NRCan working coordinate system, which is a Lambert Conformal Conic projection with standard parallels of 49 and 77 degrees, datum of NAD83, an XY tolerance of 0.001 meters, and an XY resolution of 0.0001 meters. The Canadian and U.S. data sets were displayed together and features were compared across the border. An initial set of comments and suggestions for edits were sent to the USGS by NRCan. NRCan used satellite imagery for reference during the editing process by converting the appropriate National Atlas 1:1,000,000-scale map layers and the 250K Canadian topographic data to KML and loading the KMLs into GoogleEarth. Using the cursor coordinates in the ArcMap status bar, NRCan visually navigated and correlated the ArcMap and GoogleEarth vectors. NRCan exported their findings and sent them to the USGS for correction and (or) further comment. USGS reviewed the Canadian findings and returned the data to NRCan with comments. The U.S. data were either edited, not edited and further explanation was requested, or not edited and changes were suggested for the Canadian data. This process was repeated until both NRCan and USGS felt that the data were satisfactorily harmonized.</procdesc>
